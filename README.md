  ## Description
  Everytime when creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a README for the app. This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This allows to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. It also helps the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. This README should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, who are the contributors and a way to comunicate with the developer regarding any problem or question.

  The only requirements are to have the files in your local storage and have the inquirer installed.  

  ## Usage
  You need to run the code node ./index.js in your console. 
  Then you'll be prompted for information about your application repository.
  This is how the final product should look like. ![readme](./images/readme.png)
